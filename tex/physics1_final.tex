  Here is a non-trivial machine that delivers a kind of mechanical
  advantage. To what mass can I set $m_2$ such that the system would

  gets placed on to the belt, and what is the kinetic energy change $\Delta K$?

\begin{problem} (From the Recitation on bouncing)
  Consider a pool shot to be an elastic collision between balls of equal
  masses. The cue ball is moving before the collision and the object
  ball is at rest. Use a precise geometric argument to explain why,
  immediately after the collision, the
  object ball and the cue ball move along paths that are at right angles to one another.

\begin{problem} (From the Recitation on oscillations)
  Consider a mass $M$ on a spring of spring constant $k$, released from
  rest at $t=0$ but from a distance $X$ (in the $x$-direction, which is
  parallel to the spring) away from the equilibrium position for the
  mass.  Assume there are no other forces acting.
  The mass will oscillate.
  Plot three curves---the kinetic energy, the potential energy, and the total
  mechanical energy---of the mass as a function of time, all on the same plot,
  for a few periods of oscillation.
  Be sure to label all three curves clearly.

  mean squared velocity $\langle v_x^2\rangle$ in the $x$-direction. What is the
  mean pressure caused by the particle collisions
  with one of the two walls that is oriented normal to the $x$ direction?
