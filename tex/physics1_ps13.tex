\section*{NYU Physics I---Problem Set 13}

Due Thursday 2018 December 6 at the beginning of lecture.

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
Get a sense of the speed of light by computing two things:

\textsl{(a)} How many times could light go around the equator of the Earth
in a time interval of $1\,\s$?

\textsl{(b)} How long (in ns) does it take light to go $1\,\ft$?

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
From the notes at \url{http://cosmo.nyu.edu/hogg/sr/},
Problem 3--4. Note that there is a typo in this part \textsl{(d)} of this
problem: It is the Earth that replies, not the station.

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
From the notes at \url{http://cosmo.nyu.edu/hogg/sr/},
Problem 2--14.

\paragraph{\problemname~\theproblem:}\refstepcounter{problem}%
\textsl{(a)} What is $\gamma$ to first order in $\beta^2$ for $\beta
<< 1$? That is, construct a Taylor Series for $\gamma$ in terms of
$\beta^2$ and give the zeroth-order term (1) and then the first-order
term.

\textsl{(b)} What are $\beta$ and $\gamma$ for a person walking
(relative to the sidewalk), a driver on the freeway (relative to the
road), a commercial jet (relative to the air), and an astronaut in the
ISS (relative to the center of mass of the Earth)? Use the first-order
expression from part \textsl{(a)} to compute the $\gamma$ values.

\textsl{(c)} Computing the full time dilation effect in gravity is
complicated! However, the pure kinematic part of the time dilation
only depends on $\gamma$. Two twins part. One gets on the ISS for a
year, and one stays on Earth. When they are reunited in a year, how
much younger is the astronaut than the homebody?

\paragraph{Extra Problem (will not be graded for credit):}%
If the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic) of a point particle is
$\gamma\,m\,c^2$, use the result from \problemname~3 above to get an
approximate expression for the kinetic energy at low speeds.
